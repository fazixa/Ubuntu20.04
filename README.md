# Ubuntu20.04
I installed and reinstalled Ubuntu frequently and I went through a lot of trouble installing packages. So I'm documenting every thing and every step that worked for me for my convienec.

##Essentials
'sudo apt update'
'sudo apt upgrade'

### chrome 
'wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb'
'sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb'


##Python Packages
'sudo apt install python3-pip'
